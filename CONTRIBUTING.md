# Contributing

Rust Guideposts are a free community resource, and we welcome help.

Anyone can edit these guideposts to improve them, such as to edit an existing page, or add a new page, or refactor how the pages are organized. You can do this a variety of ways.

* You can create a GitHub pull request that provides the changes you want.

* You can open a GitHub issue that provides your suggestions, and we can converse about what you want.

* You can contact the maintainer via email at joel@joelparkerhenderson.com.

If you would like to contribute work, then your work will use the project license, which is Creative Commons Attribution Non Commercial Share Alike 4.0 International (CC-BY-NC-SA-4.0). This is a free libre open source license that encourages people to share improvements.

If you're interested in creating new topic pages, then we suggest you try ChatGPT, because what we're seeing in practice is ChatGPT is pretty good at creating a first draft of a topic page. Then can edit the topic page as you wish.
