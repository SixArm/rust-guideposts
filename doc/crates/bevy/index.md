# Bevy crate for game programming

<https://crates.io/crates/bevy>

The Rust bevy crate provides ways to develop high-performance games with modern graphics and audio capabilities. Bevy offers a data-driven, component-based architecture that makes it easy to create and modify game mechanics, systems, and entities in a flexible and scalable manner.

Bevy use an Entity-Component-System (ECS) architecture, which organizes game data into entities that are made up of components, and systems that process those components. ECS allows for powerful and flexible game logic that can be easily extended and modified.

Bevy uses event-driven design. Events that trigger specific actions and behaviors, such as when a user clicks a button or a new object is spawned in the game world. Events can be used to control game flow, trigger animations, or handle user input.

Bevy includes an asset management system that enables developers to easily load and use resources such as textures, meshes, and sound effects within their games.

Bevy includes utility functions and components that make it easy to work with common game development tasks such as handling player movement, collision detection, and input devices.

In addition to its core features, Rust bevy also offers a growing ecosystem of plugins and extensions that expand its capabilities. These include plugins for physics simulations, networking, and more.

Bevy's official website has a Getting Started guide, which provides a step-by-step approach to build a simple game using the Bevy ecosystem, including graphics and user interaction. Bevy's Example Gallery showcases a variety of games and applications, providing the source code to explore and learn from. The Bevy Book is an open-source book that covers in-depth topics on Bevy, including game but also interactive applications design and code.
