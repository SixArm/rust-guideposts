# yew crate for client-side web app

The Rust yew crate is a web development framework that allows developing fast and efficient client-side web applications using Rust programming language. The Yew crate uses a virtual DOM implementation to efficiently handle changes and updates to the user interface. 

Key features include:

- Single-file components: This feature allows developers to write reusable code components in a single file, making it easier to manage and maintain the codebase.

- Rust type system: With Rust's type system, developers can write safer, more efficient code with fewer bugs and memory errors.

- Reactive programming: The Yew crate allows developers to use reactive programming, which makes it easier to manage and update the UI automatically as state and data changes.

- Web assembly support: The Rust yew crate supports web assembly, which makes it easier to write web apps that can run natively on desktop and mobile devices.

The Yew crate is similar to React in terms of concepts and usage, but it is written entirely in Rust, and it is optimized for performance and safety.
