# Criterion crate for benchmarks

<https://crates.io/crates/criterion>

The Rust Criterion crate, titled Criterion.rs, is a popular benchmarking library. It is used to measure and analyze the performance of Rust programs by running multiple iterations of a benchmark and collecting statistical data.

Criterion.rs provides a simple and intuitive API for writing benchmarks, allowing developers to create and run benchmarks quickly and easily. It supports a range of benchmarking options, including measuring CPU time, wall-clock time, memory usage, and more.

The crate uses statistical techniques to calculate benchmark results, which provides more accurate and reliable results than simple timing measurements. It also supports reporting and visualization of benchmark results, making it easier for developers to analyze and compare their code's performance.

Features:

* Statistics: Statistical analysis detects if, and by how much, performance has changed since the last benchmark run.

* Charts: Uses gnuplot to generate detailed graphs of benchmark results; see the gnuplot website for installation instructions.

* Stable-compatible: Benchmark your code without installing nightly Rust.

Overall, Criterion.rs is an essential tool for Rust programmers who want to optimize the performance of their programs and ensure they are running efficiently.
