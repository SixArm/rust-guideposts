# cargo-crev for community-driven trust

<https://crates.io/crates/cargo-crev>

The Rust cargo-crev crate helps developers build a community-driven trust system for their packages. The crate provides a way for developers to create signed reviews of their dependencies and share them with other developers. These reviews can include information about the quality of the code, how well the documentation is written, and any security concerns.

The idea behind cargo-crev is to create a trusted network of developers who can vouch for the quality and safety of each other's code. This can help prevent malicious packages from being added to the Rust ecosystem and can provide a sense of security for developers who rely on Rust packages in their projects.

Using cargo-crev, developers can create public or private reviews of their dependencies, and other developers can use these reviews to make informed decisions about which packages to use in their projects. The crate also provides a command-line interface that makes it easy to manage reviews and share them with the community.

Key features:

* Build a web of trust of users to help verify the code you use

* Warn you about untrustworthy crates and security vulnerabilities

* Increase trustworthiness of your own code
