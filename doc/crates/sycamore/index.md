# Sycamore crate for reactive front-end

<https://crates.io/crates/sycamore>

The Rust sycamore crate provides a reactive front-end web development framework. It uses a Virtual DOM (VDOM) and a declarative syntax that is similar to ReactJS.

The sycamore crate provides various features and functionalities that help developers build fast and high-performance web applications. It supports various event handling, state management, and data flow features.

* Lightning speed: Sycamore harnesses the full power of Rust via WebAssembly, giving you full control over performance.

* Ergonomic and intuitive: Write code that feels natural. Everything is built on reactive primitives without a cumbersome virtual DOM.

* No JavaScript: Create apps using Sycamore without touching a single line of JS.

With sycamore, you can create dynamic and responsive web applications that allow efficient dynamic changes without the need for full-page refreshes. Moreover, sycamore has been designed to be compatible with most of the modern web browsers and it provides a scalable API that can be extended easily.

Example of a sycamore component:

```rust
#[component]
fn Hello<G: Html>(cx: Scope) -> View<G> {
    view! { cx,
        p { "Hello, World!" }
    }
}
```
