# hyper crate for HTTP clients/servers

<https://crates.io/crates/hyper>

The Rust Hyper crate is a popular library for writing HTTP clients and servers in the Rust programming language. It provides a high-level and efficient API for handling HTTP requests and responses, as well as low-level control over the details of the HTTP protocol.

With the Hyper crate, developers can easily build custom HTTP clients and servers, handle HTTP authentication, manage cookies, and perform SSL/TLS encryption. It supports both synchronous and asynchronous programming styles, and is compatible with Rust's built-in async/await syntax.

One of the key advantages of using the Hyper crate is its performance. It's built using Rust's memory safety and zero-cost abstractions, which makes it fast and efficient. Additionally, the Hyper crate is designed to be modular and extensible, which makes it easy to add custom functionality and plugins.

hyper is a relatively low-level library, meant to be a building block for libraries and applications.

* If you want a convenient HTTP client, then consider `reqwest`.

* If you want a convenient HTTP server, then consider `warp`.

Both are built on top of hyper.
