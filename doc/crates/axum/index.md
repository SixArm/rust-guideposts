# axum crate for web services

<https://crates.io/crates/axum>

The Rust axum crate provides a fast, low-level web framework for building microservices and APIs. Axum is designed to be easy to use, performant, and composable, meaning you can mix and match components to build a custom web application that meets your needs.

Axum is built on top of Rust's async/await syntax and uses Tokio as its underlying async runtime. This means that Axum is well-suited for building high-performance, non-blocking web services that can handle a large number of concurrent requests.

Axum provides a number of features that make it a powerful tool for building web applications, including:

* Routing: Axum makes it easy to define routes for your web application, allowing you to map URLs to specific functions or handlers.

* Middleware: Axum supports middleware, which are functions that can be run before or after a request is processed. Middleware can be used for things like logging, authentication, and authorization.

* Error handling: Axum provides a flexible error handling system that allows you to handle errors in a way that makes sense for your application.

* Testing: Axum includes tools for testing your web application, making it easy to write automated tests for your code.

Overall, Rust axum is well-suited for building microservices and APIs. If you're looking for a fast, low-level framework that gives you complete control over your web application, then Axum is definitely worth considering.
