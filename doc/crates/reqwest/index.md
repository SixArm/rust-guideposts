# reqwest crate for HTTP requests

<https://crates.io/crates/reqwest>

The Rust reqwest crate is for making HTTP requests. It is built on top of the Rust async runtime, which makes it efficient and suitable for high-performance networking applications.

With reqwest, you can easily make HTTP requests and handle responses in a synchronous or asynchronous manner. The crate provides a set of simple and intuitive APIs for performing HTTP GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, and other types of requests. It also includes support for request/response headers, URL parameters, and request/response bodies.

One of the key features of reqwest is its ability to handle HTTPS connections by default, using the native TLS implementation in Rust. This means that you can securely connect to HTTPS endpoints without having to add any additional dependencies or configuration.

The reqwest crate also includes support for more advanced features like connection pooling, timeouts, cookies, authentication, and logging.

Example:

```rust
use reqwest::Error;

async fn make_request(url: &str) -> Result<String, Error> {
    let response = reqwest::get(url).await?;
    let body = response.text().await?;
    Ok(body)
}

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() -> Result<(), Error> {
    let url = "https://www.example.com";
    let response_body = make_request(url).await?;
    println!("{}", response_body);
    Ok(())
}
```
