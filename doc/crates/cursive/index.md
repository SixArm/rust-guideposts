# Cursive crate for text user interfaces

<https://crates.io/crates/cursive>

The Rust Cursive crate is a TUI (text user interface) library for building interactive terminal applications. It allows developers to create rich terminal UIs with features such as customizable layouts, event handling, input handling, and styling.

Cursive is built on top of the Rust `ncurses` library, which provides low-level terminal I/O and screen rendering. Cursive provides a higher-level API than ncurses, making it easier to build complex UIs without worrying about the details of terminal control.

Some of the key features of cursive include:

* A flexible layout system that allows developers to create complex, dynamic UIs with ease.

* Support for a wide range of input events, including mouse input and keyboard shortcuts.

* A rich set of widgets, including buttons, checkboxes, text fields, and more.

* Customizable theming and styling, with support for colors, fonts, and text effects.

* Support for Unicode and UTF-8 input and display.

* A robust documentation and community resources.

Overall, the Rust Cursive crate is a powerful tool for building interactive terminal applications in Rust. Its high-level API, flexibility, and rich feature set make it an excellent choice for developers looking to build text-based UIs with ease.
