# Rayon crate for parallelism

<https://crates.io/crates/rayon>

The Rust rayon crate provides a high-level API for data parallelism. It allows developers to write code that can automatically be parallelized across multiple threads, without needing to manage low-level details of thread creation and synchronization.

The rayon crate provides several features that make parallelism easier:

* Parallel iterators: The rayon crate provides parallel versions of many of the standard iterators in Rust, such as `map()`, `filter()`, and `fold()`. These parallel iterators allow developers to write code that can automatically be parallelized, without needing to write low-level threading code.

* Parallel collections: The rayon crate provides parallel versions of several standard Rust collections, such as `Vec` and `HashMap`. These collections allow developers to work with large data sets and automatically parallelize their code, without needing to manually split the data into chunks and manage thread synchronization.

* Work stealing: The rayon crate uses a work stealing algorithm to dynamically load balance the work across all available threads. This means that if one thread finishes its work early, it can automatically start working on tasks that are still pending on other threads, improving overall performance.

* Crossbeam integration: The rayon crate integrates seamlessly with the `crossbeam` crate, which provides low-level primitives for concurrent programming, such as locks and channels. This allows developers to combine high-level parallelism with low-level concurrency, as needed.

Overall, the `rayon` crate provides easy data parallelism in Rust, allowing developers to take advantage of modern hardware and achieve high performance in their applications without sacrificing safety and correctness.
