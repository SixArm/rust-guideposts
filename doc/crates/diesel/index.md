# Diesel crate for ORM

<https://crates.io/crates/diesel>

The Rust Diesel crate is a high-level, type-safe ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) library for Rust that provides a convenient and safe way to interact with relational databases. It provides a set of tools and abstractions for working with SQL databases, allowing developers to write safe and efficient code when working with databases.

Some of the key features of Rust Diesel include:

* Type-safe queries: Rust Diesel allows developers to write SQL queries using Rust code, making it easy to construct complex queries while ensuring that they are type-safe.

* Easy to use: Rust Diesel provides a simple and intuitive API for working with databases, making it easy to get started with database programming in Rust.

* High performance: Rust Diesel uses Rust's zero-cost abstractions and compile-time code generation to provide high performance when interacting with databases.

* Support for multiple databases: Rust Diesel supports a wide range of databases, including PostgreSQL, MySQL, and SQLite.

* Schema migrations: Rust Diesel provides a simple and powerful schema migration system, making it easy to manage changes to the database schema over time.
