# Cross-compiling for multiple platforms

Cross-compiling is the process of compiling code for a platform different from the one on which the code is compiled.

Rust supports cross-compiling, which means that you can compile Rust code on one platform and generate executable code for another platform, such as Windows, Linux, or macOS.

To cross-compile Rust code, you need to install a cross-compiler toolchain for the target platform. This toolchain includes the Rust compiler, standard library, and any other dependencies required to build the code. You can install cross-compilers for different architectures using Rust's built-in tool, rustup.

Once the cross-compiler toolchain is installed, you can use the cargo command to build your Rust project for the target platform. You can specify the target platform by setting the --target option when running the cargo build or cargo run command.

For example, to build a Rust project for the ARM architecture, you would use the following command:

```sh
cargo build --target=arm-unknown-linux-gnueabihf
```

This command tells cargo to build the project for the ARM architecture using the GNU toolchain and the Hard Float ABI.

Cross-compiling Rust code can be useful for a variety of scenarios, such as building applications for embedded systems or developing software that needs to run on multiple platforms. Rust's strong type system and memory safety guarantees make it a good choice for writing cross-platform applications that require high performance and reliability.
