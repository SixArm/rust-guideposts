# Concurrency and parallelism

In Rust, concurrency refers to the ability of a program to perform multiple tasks or operations at the same time, while parallelism refers to the ability of a program to perform multiple tasks or operations simultaneously, using multiple processors or cores.

Rust provides mechanisms for concurrency and parallelism:

* Threads: Rust's standard library provides a low-level interface for creating and managing threads. Threads allow a program to execute multiple tasks in parallel, but require careful synchronization to avoid data races and other concurrency issues.

* Channels: Rust's channels provide a high-level mechanism for communication between threads. Channels allow multiple threads to send and receive data, and ensure that the data is transmitted in a synchronized and safe manner.

* Futures: Rust's futures provide a mechanism for asynchronous programming, allowing a program to perform non-blocking I/O and other operations without blocking the main thread. Futures are composable and can be combined to create complex asynchronous workflows.

* Atomic types: Rust's atomic types provide a safe and efficient way to share data between threads. Atomic types are designed to be thread-safe, and provide operations that ensure that data is updated atomically, without the need for locks or other synchronization mechanisms.

Rust's concurrency and parallelism mechanisms are designed to be safe and efficient, and take advantage of Rust's ownership and borrowing system to prevent data races and other concurrency issues. Additionally, Rust's compiler provides powerful static analysis and optimization tools that can help identify and eliminate potential issues in concurrent and parallel code.
