# Programming language theory

The Rust programming language design is informed by various programming language (PL) theories, such as type theory, ownership theory, and concurrency theory.

* Type theory is a branch of mathematical logic that studies types and their relationships. In Rust, type theory ensures that programs are safe and correct at compile-time. Rust has a strong type system that allows the compiler to catch errors such as null pointer dereferences, buffer overflows, and data races at compile-time, rather than at runtime. Rust's type system is also expressive and flexible, allowing developers to write code that is both safe and efficient.

* Ownership theory is a concept that is unique to Rust. Ownership refers to the idea that every piece of memory in a Rust program has an owner, and there can only be one owner at a time. Ownership prevents data races and other memory safety issues that can occur in concurrent programs. In Rust, ownership is enforced at compile-time, and the compiler ensures that the rules of ownership are followed.

* Concurrency theory is the study of concurrent programming, which is the process of writing programs that execute multiple tasks simultaneously. Rust's design is informed by concurrency theory, and it provides several features for writing concurrent programs, such as threads, channels, and futures. Rust's concurrency features are designed to be safe and efficient, allowing developers to write concurrent programs that are both fast and reliable.

Rust's design combines these programming language theories in a unique way to provide a language that is safe, fast, and concurrent. By using type theory, ownership theory, and concurrency theory, Rust provides a powerful tool for writing systems software that is reliable and efficient.
