# Git commit template

<https://github.com/joelparkerhenderson/git-commit-template>

A Git commit template is a file you create in your project, that automatically displays when any of your project developers start a new commit. A good Git commit template can improve your documentation, teamwork, tracking, and analytics.

We recommend this Git commit template as a starting point:

```txt
# Write a title summarizing what this commit does.
# Use present tense imperative, such as Add, Drop,
# Fix, Start, Stop, Bump, Refactor, Optimize, etc.
Add your title here

# Why is this change happening? Focus on the purpose/goal/etc.
Why:

# How is this change happening? Describe any specs/algos/etc.
How:

# Add any tags you want, such as #tags, keywords, codes, etc.
Tags:

# Git trailers are optional. Use them if/how you wish.
# The ones below are examples we use; use if you wish.

# For example, you can add any relevant links, such as to a
# ticket tracker, or mockup, or specification, or RFC, etc.
See: Your Text Here <https://example.com/...>

# If the commit is sponsored by people or companies, then you
# can add them here; this can be helpful for funding projects.
Sponsored-by: Name <name@example.com>

# If the commit is written by multiple people, then you can
# list each person as a co-author; some git tools use this.
Co-authored-by: Name <name@example.com>
Co-authored-by: Name <name@example.com>
```
