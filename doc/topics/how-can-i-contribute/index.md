# How can I contribute?

Rust Quick Guide provides a free community resource, and we welcome help.

Anyone can edit these summaries to improve them, such as to edit an existing page, or add a new page, or refactor how the pages are organized. You can do this a variety of ways.

* You can create a GitHub pull request that provides the changes you want.

* You can open a GitHub issue that provides your suggestions, and we can converse about what you want.

* You can contact the maintainer via email at joel@joelparkerhenderson.com.
