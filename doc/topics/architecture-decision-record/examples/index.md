# Architecture decision record - example

**Title**: Introduction of Rust in the Tech Stack

**Status**: Accepted 2020-12-31

### Context

Our current tech stack relies heavily on languages like C++, Python, and Java for development. However, we're experiencing difficulties in maintaining a codebase that is highly performant and secure.

We need to explore options that provide better memory safety, concurrency support, and improved performance.

After researching options, we want to introduce Rust as a new programming language for developing certain modules within our application.

### Decision

We have decided to introduce Rust programming language in our tech stack to improve the performance and security of our codebase.

Rust's unique features such as memory safety, concurrency support, and ability to create efficient software with minimal overhead make it a suitable choice for our team.

### Consequences

The decision to introduce Rust may require additional training for our development team, which could impact project timelines. However, we believe that the long-term benefits of using Rust will outweigh any short-term challenges.

With Rust, we anticipate improved performance, better memory safety, and maintenance of a secure codebase.

Additionally, Rust may help us attract new developers who are interested in working with this cutting-edge language.
