# Architecture decision record (ADR)

<https://github.com/joelparkerhenderson/architecture-decision-record>

An architecture decision record (ADR) is a document that captures important architectural decisions made during the development of software solutions. It is used to communicate the reasoning and the justification behind the choices made, as well as their potential impact on the overall architecture of the system.

The ADR explains the problem being addressed and the decision that was made to solve it. It provides a detailed description of the decision-making process, including the factors considered, the alternatives evaluated, and the risks involved.

The ADR serves as a living document that can be referred to throughout the development process, providing insight into the design philosophy and decision-making process of the team. It can also provide a historical record of the reasons behind decisions, which can help future development teams understand the thought process and avoid repeating past mistakes.

Overall, an Architecture Decision Record is a useful tool for maintaining transparency and sharing knowledge among development teams, ensuring that important decisions are recorded and communicated effectively.
