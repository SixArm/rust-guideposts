Several Rust projects by the same author may be helpful.


## Demo Rust Axum

This project demonstrates Rust and the axum web framework. The project also shows tower for clients and servers, hyper for HTTP, tokio for asynchronous I/O, and Serde for serialization/deserialization.


## Assertables Rust crate

<https://github.com/sixarm/assertables-rust-crate>

The Assertables Rust crate provides many assert macros, such as `assert_starts_with`, `asserts_contains`, and `asserts_is_match`. There are also macros for testing arrays and vectors, function results, readers and streams, and more.


## Collectables Rust crate 

<https://github.com/sixarm/collectibles-rust-crate>

The Collectables Rust crate provides helpers for standard library collections. The crate provides two general-purpose collections helpers: `BTreeMapToSet` based on `BTreeMap` and `BTreeSet`, and `HashMapToSet` based `HashMap` and `HashSet`. 


## checkline Rust crate

<https://github.com/sixarm/checkline-rust-crate>

The `checkline` crate is a command-line checkbox line picker: it reads lines from stdin, prompts the user with a checkbox per line, then outputs lines to stdout. This crate is a good introduction to the Cursive TUI crate.
