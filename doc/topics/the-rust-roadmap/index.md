# The Rust roadmap

The Rust roadmap is a high-level plan that outlines the goals, priorities, and direction of the Rust programming language for the next several years. The roadmap is developed by the Rust core team and is informed by community feedback, user needs, and technical challenges.

The Rust roadmap is divided into three main categories:

* Language: This category includes improvements to the Rust language itself, such as adding new syntax, improving performance, and simplifying usage. Some of the specific goals in this category include stabilizing async/await, improving const generics, and adding better support for embedded systems.

* Ecosystem: This category includes improvements to the Rust tooling, libraries, and community, such as making it easier to use Rust for web development, improving the Rust packaging and distribution system, and enhancing the Rust documentation and learning resources.

* Community: This category includes initiatives to make the Rust community more diverse, inclusive, and welcoming, such as improving the Rust governance and decision-making process, promoting Rust education and outreach, and supporting the Rust community events and conferences.

The Rust roadmap is not a fixed plan, and it is subject to change based on feedback and new developments. The Rust core team periodically updates the roadmap to reflect new priorities, challenges, and opportunities. Developers who want to contribute to Rust or use Rust for their projects can consult the roadmap to understand the direction and focus of the language and the community.
