# Futures for asynchronous operations

In Rust, a future is a type that represents an asynchronous operation that may not have completed yet. Futures are for writing non-blocking code, such as to read a file, make a web request, or query a database.

Rust's futures are composable, which means that multiple futures can be combined to create more complex workflows. Futures can be chained together to form a pipeline, with each future as a step in the pipeline. When a future completes, it can trigger the next future to execute.

Futures are executed by an executor, which is responsible for scheduling and running the futures. Rust provides several built-in executors.

Example of a Rust future for an asynchronous HTTP request:

```rust
use futures::Future;
use reqwest::Url;

async fn fetch_url(url: Url) -> Result<String, reqwest::Error> {
    let response = reqwest::get(url).await?;
    let text = response.text().await?;
    Ok(text)
}

fn main() {
    let url = Url::parse("https://example.com").unwrap();
    let future = fetch_url(url);
    let runtime = tokio::runtime::Runtime::new().unwrap();
    let text = runtime.block_on(future).unwrap();
    println!("response text is {}", text)
}
```

This example defines an asynchronous function `fetch_url`. The function accepts a URL, then uses the `reqwest` crate to make an HTTP GET request to the URL, then returns the response text as a `String`.

The `fetch_url` function is async, so returns a `Future` that we store in a variable. We use the tokio runtime to run the `Future`. This blocks until it completes. Finally, we print the result.
