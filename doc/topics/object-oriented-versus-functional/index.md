# Object-oriented versus functional

Rust is a multi-paradigm programming language that supports styles for object-oriented programming (OOP) and functional programming (OOP). Rust's OOP is based on the concept of structs and traits, while its FP is based on the use of closures and higher-order functions.

* In Rust's OOP, programmers can create structs that contain data fields and methods. The methods can be used to manipulate the data fields of the struct. Traits can also be used to define a set of methods that must be implemented by any struct that wants to use that trait. Traits can be used for polymorphism, allowing different structs to be used interchangeably as long as they implement the required trait.

* In Rust's FP, programmers can use closures and higher-order functions to create functions that take other functions as arguments or return functions as values. Closures are anonymous functions that can capture variables from their surrounding environment. Higher-order functions are functions that take other functions as arguments or return functions as values. These concepts enable the creation of functions that are more flexible and reusable than traditional imperative programming.

Overall, Rust's OOP provides ways to define data structures and methods that operate on them, while Rust's FP provides ways to define algorithms and functions that can be composed and reused.
