# Who is this for?

Rust Guideposts are for anyone who wants to learn about Rust, and who likes to browse quick topic summaries. We're creating it because we are very excited about Rust, and very excited about more people learning Rust.

We're creating these guideposts to help teach students and junior-intermediate developers who are generally familiar with introductory programming concepts and programming languages.

Questions that come up frequently with our students and developers:

* Questions about Rust in context, such as how Rust relates to their own interests, and to other programming languages.

* Questions about Rust language concepts, such as memory management, traits, and futures.

* Questions about Rust in practice, such as how to access a database, what tools do, and which libraries to choose.

These guideposts are trying to answer these kinds of questions quickly and simply. Browse the topics you want, and skip the rest. And if you have questions, you can let us know, because we're continually adding topics and improving these guideposts.
