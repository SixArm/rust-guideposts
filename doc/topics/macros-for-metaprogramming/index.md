# Macros for metaprogramming

Rust macros are a powerful tool for metaprogramming, allowing you to write code that generates code at compile-time. Macros are defined using the macro_rules! macro, which allows you to match on patterns in the code and generate new code based on those patterns.

Rust macros can be used for a variety of tasks, such as creating domain-specific languages (DSLs), reducing boilerplate code, or implementing code generation tools.

There are two types of Rust macros: declarative macros and procedural macros.

Declarative macros (also known as "macro_rules! macros") use pattern matching to transform code. They are defined using the `macro_rules!` macro and operate on the tokens that make up the code. Declarative macros can be used to create new syntax or simplify existing syntax, and they are often used to create DSLs.

Procedural macros, on the other hand, operate on the AST (abstract syntax tree) of the code. They are defined using Rust's proc_macro API and allow you to write code that generates new code at compile-time. Procedural macros can be used to implement custom derive macros, attribute macros, and function-like macros.

Example of a declarative macro:

```rust
macro_rules! greet {
    (to $name:ident) => {
        println!("Hello, {}!", stringify!($name));
    };
}
```
This macro takes a value, in this case `name`, and generates a custom greeting message for it.
