# println! macro for printing output

The Rust `println!` macro is a built-in macro that is used to print text to stdout (standard output).

Here is an example code that uses the `println!` macro to print a simple message to the console:

```rust
fn main() {
    println!("Hello, World!");
}
```

In this example, we call the `println!` macro with one argument: the string `"Hello, World!"`. The macro then prints the string to the console.

The `println!` macro is similar to the `print!` macro, but adds a newline character (`\n`) to the end of the output, while the `print!` macro does not.

The `println!` macro can also accept additional arguments for string formatting. For example, we can use the `{}` placeholder to insert variables or values into the output string:

```rust
fn main() {
    let name = "Alice";
    let age = 30;
    println!("My name is {} and age is {}", name, age);
}
```

In this example, we use two placeholders (`{}`) in the output string to print the values of the `name` and `age` variables. When the macro is executed, it replaces the `{}` placeholders with the corresponding values (`"Alice"` and `30`, respectively). The resulting output would be:

```txt
My name is Alice and age is 30
```

The `println!` macro is similar to the `format!` macro for formatting strings, and the `write!` macro for writing formatted data into a buffer.
