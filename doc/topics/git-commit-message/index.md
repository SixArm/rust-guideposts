# Git commit message

<https://github.com/joelparkerhenderson/git-commit-message/>

For the best git commit messages, use these top recommendations:

* Emphasize clear communication, to help your collaborators.

* Focus on "why", such as the purpose, use case, or user story.

* Use a git commit template. See the next page for more about this.

Begin with a short summary line a.k.a. message subject:

* Start with an imperative: Add, Drop, Fix, Refactor, Optimize, etc.

* Use up to 50 characters; this is the git official preference.

* Omit meta-information, such as a category id, task id, etc.

* Finish without a sentence-ending period.

Continue with a longer description a.k.a. message body:

* Add a blank line after the summary line, then write all you wish.

* Include any kinds of tags, keywords, search codes, etc. as you wish.

* Include any kind of notes, links, examples, specs, etc. as you wish.

* Use up to 72 characters per line for typical text for word wrap.

* Use as many characters as needed for atypical text, such as URLs, source code, terminal output, formatted messages, etc.

End with git trailers as you wish:

* Use syntax `Keyword: Value` with any keyword and value you want.

* Use syntax `See: Example <https://example.com>` with a description and URL, to link to related information, such as a specification page, mockup image, task tracker, RFC, repo, etc.

* Consider more trailers, such as `Sponsored-by`, `Co-authored-by`, etc.
