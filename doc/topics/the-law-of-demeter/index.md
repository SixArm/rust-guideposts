# The Law of Demeter

The Law of Demeter is a design principle that applies to object-oriented programming, including Rust. The Law of Demeter, also known as the "principle of least knowledge," states that an object should have limited knowledge of other objects, and that it should only interact with objects that are directly related to its purpose.

In Rust, this principle can be applied by designing your code to minimize the number of dependencies between different components of your application. This can be achieved by following a few key guidelines:

* Each module or object should only communicate with its immediate neighbors, and not with objects further down the chain.

* When a module or object needs to interact with another object, it should only communicate with its public interface, and not directly with its internal state.

* Avoid passing long chains of dependencies or complex objects between modules or functions. Instead, pass only the information or data that is necessary for the task at hand.

By following the Law of Demeter, you can help ensure that your code is more modular, easier to maintain, and less prone to errors. It also helps to make your code more scalable and flexible, as changes to one module or object will have less impact on the rest of the application.
