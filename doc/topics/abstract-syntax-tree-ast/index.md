# Abstract syntax tree (AST)

An abstract syntax tree (AST) is a data structure used in computer science to represent the structure of a program in a way that can be easily analyzed and manipulated by algorithms.

An AST is created by analyzing the source code of a program and breaking it down into a tree-like structure that represents its syntax.

Each node in the tree represents a syntactic construct in the program, such as a function call, a variable declaration, or an if statement. The nodes in the tree are connected by edges that represent the relationships between the constructs.

The main advantage of using an AST is that it provides a way to analyze the program's structure and behavior without having to execute the code. This makes it possible to perform tasks such as code optimization, program transformation, and error detection without having to actually run the program.

ASTs are commonly used in compilers, interpreters, and other tools that analyze or manipulate source code. For example, a compiler may use an AST to perform optimizations such as dead code elimination or loop unrolling, while a static analyzer may use an AST to detect potential security vulnerabilities or other code quality issues.

Overall, abstract syntax trees are a powerful tool for working with programs, allowing developers to reason about their structure and behavior in a way that is both precise and efficient.
