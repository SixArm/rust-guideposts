# Dependency injection (DI)

Dependency injection (DI) is a design pattern that reduces the coupling between different components of a software system. In Rust, DI can be implemented using various techniques, such as trait objects, closures, and macros.

The basic idea behind DI is that instead of a component creating its dependencies directly, it receives them from an external source. This allows the component to be more flexible and easier to test, since its dependencies can be easily substituted with mock objects or other implementations.

In Rust, one way to implement DI is through the use of trait objects. A trait object is a pointer to a value that implements a specific trait. By using trait objects, we can create components that depend on abstractions rather than concrete types. For example, instead of a component depending on a specific implementation of a database connection, it could depend on a trait object that represents a generic database connection. This would allow us to easily swap out different database implementations without affecting the component's code.

Another way to implement DI in Rust is through the use of closures. A closure is a function that captures variables from its surrounding environment. By passing a closure to a component, we can provide it with the functionality it needs without directly creating dependencies on concrete types.

Finally, Rust also has several macro libraries, such as `di-rs`, that provide DI capabilities through code generation. These macros allow developers to define their dependencies in a declarative way, and generate the necessary code to wire everything together.

In summary, DI is a design pattern that helps reduce coupling between components in a software system. In Rust, DI can be implemented using various techniques such as trait objects, closures, and macros, and can provide benefits such as improved flexibility and testability.
