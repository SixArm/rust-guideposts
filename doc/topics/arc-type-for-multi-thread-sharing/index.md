# Arc type for multi-thread sharing

In Rust, `Arc` (Atomically Reference Counted) is a smart pointer that provides shared ownership of a value, similar to `Rc` (Reference Counted) smart pointer. The difference is that `Arc` can be safely shared between threads, for concurrent programming; this is because `Arc` uses atomic operations to increment and decrement the reference count.

`Arc` works by keeping track of the number of references to a value. When a new reference to the value is created, `Arc` increments the reference count. When an existing reference is dropped, `Arc` decrements the reference count. When the reference count reaches zero, `Arc` drops the value. When an `Arc` is cloned, a new pointer to the same value is created, and the reference count is incremented.

```rust
use std::sync::Arc;
use std::thread;

fn main() {
    let shared_data = Arc::new(vec![1, 2, 3]);
    for i in 0..3 {
        let data = shared_data.clone();
        thread::spawn(move || {
            let vec = data.iter()
            .map(|x| x + i).collect::<Vec<_>>();
            println!("{:?}", vec);
        });
    }
}
```

Here, an `Arc` shares ownership of a vector between multiple threads. The `Arc::new()` function creates a new `Arc` that points to a vector of `[1, 2, 3]`. The `clone()` method creates a new `Arc` that points to the same vector, and the reference count is incremented. The `thread::spawn()` function creates three threads, each of which iterates over the vector and adds the current loop index to each element. The results are collected into a new vector, which is printed to the console.
