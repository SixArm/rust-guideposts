# What are Rust Guideposts?

Rust Guideposts are quick topic summaries to help people learn about the Rust programming language, ecosystem, concepts, crates, and more.

You can try any topic, in any order, at any time, akin to a frequently asked questions resource.

Rust Guideposts work best as an adjunct to a comprehensive Rust book, such as the The Rust Programming Language.

A comprehensive book is valuable to read, cover to cover, for thorough technical explanations.

We welcome constructive advice, new topic ideas, pull requests, open issues, and the like. See CONTRIBUTING.md. Rust Guideposts are continually evolving, with ongoing additions, corrections, and optimizations.
