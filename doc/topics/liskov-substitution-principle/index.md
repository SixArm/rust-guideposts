# Liskov substitution principle (LSP)

The Liskov substitution principle (LSP) is a fundamental principle of the object-oriented programming paradigm, and it states that any instance of a class must be replaceable with an instance of its derived classes without affecting the correctness of the program.

In the context of Rust, this principle can be seen in action through the use of trait objects. A trait in Rust is similar to an interface in other programming languages, and it defines a set of methods that a type must implement. A trait object, on the other hand, is a value that can hold any type that implements the trait.

Using trait objects in Rust ensures that the Liskov substitution principle is upheld. Since any type that implements the trait can be used interchangeably, it becomes easier to modify, extend, and re-use code. This approach also enhances the flexibility of Rust's type system since it makes it possible to store a collection of different types that share a common trait.

Overall, Rust's use of trait objects promotes a secure and robust codebase by guaranteeing at compile-time that any substitution of instances within classes is well-suited to run the program correctly.
