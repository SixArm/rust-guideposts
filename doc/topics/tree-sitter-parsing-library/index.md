# Tree-sitter parsing library

Tree-sitter is a parsing library that allows developers to create robust and efficient parsers for programming languages, configuration files, and other structured documents. It was created by Rasmus Andersson and is written in Rust.

The library uses the tree-sitter parsing algorithm, which is a powerful parsing technique that builds an abstract syntax tree (AST) for the parsed code. The AST is a tree structure that represents the structure of the code, making it easier to analyze and manipulate.

One of the key advantages of Rust tree-sitter is its speed and efficiency. It is designed to be extremely fast, allowing it to handle large codebases and parse files in real-time. It also uses incremental parsing, which means that it can efficiently update the AST as changes are made to the code.

Rust tree-sitter is also highly modular, with a simple and flexible API that allows developers to easily create custom parsers for new languages or modify existing parsers. It supports a wide range of programming languages, including C, C++, Java, Python, Ruby, and many others.

Overall, Rust tree-sitter is a powerful and flexible parsing library that can be used to create high-performance parsers for a wide range of programming languages and structured documents.
