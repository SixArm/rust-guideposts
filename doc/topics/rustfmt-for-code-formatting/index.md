# Rustfmt for code formatting

Rustfmt is a code formatting tool for Rust programming language. It automatically reformats Rust code according to a set of predefined formatting rules, which helps developers to maintain consistent coding styles and makes it easier to read, understand and debug the code.

Rustfmt can be used as a standalone tool, or as an integrated feature within a code editor, or via a build script. It supports formatting options, including indentation style, line wrapping, brace styles, and more.

Using Rustfmt is highly recommended by the Rust community as it helps maintain a consistent coding style across a project, which in turn makes the code easier to read, maintain and understand.

To use Rustfmt, you first need to install it on your system. Rustfmt can be installed using Cargo, the package manager for Rust, by running the following command in your terminal:

```sh
cargo install rustfmt
```

You can customize the formatting rules used by Rustfmt by creating a configuration file named `rustfmt.toml` or `.rustfmt.toml` in your project directory and specifying your preferred options.

Example `rustfmt.toml` file:

```toml
comment_width = 80
format_code_in_doc_comments = true
group_imports = "StdExternalCrate"
imports_granularity = "Crate"
imports_layout = "Vertical"
indent_style = "Block"
reorder_imports = false
wrap_comments = true
```

Overall, Rustfmt is a good tool to reformat code for consistent styles.
