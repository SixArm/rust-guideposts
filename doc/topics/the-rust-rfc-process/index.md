# The Rust RFC process

<https://rust-lang.github.io/rfcs/>

The Rust RFC (Request For Comments) process is the formal mechanism for proposing, discussing, and deciding on changes to Rust. The process is intended to be transparent, collaborative, and community-driven, and it involves several stages.

1. RFC submission: Anyone can submit an RFC by creating a new issue on the Rust GitHub repository, describing the proposed change, its motivation, potential impact, and alternative solutions.

2. Initial triage: The Rust team evaluates its feasibility, alignment with the language's vision and goals, and potential impact. If the RFC is deemed appropriate for further consideration, it is assigned a tracking issue number and enters the "active" state.

3. Community feedback: The RFC is then open for community feedback and discussion on GitHub. The community can provide comments, suggestions, concerns, and questions, which the RFC author should address and update the RFC accordingly.

4. FCP (Final Comment Period): If there's consensus on the proposed change, then the RFC enters the Final Comment Period (FCP). Stakeholders review and incorporate the feedback, evaluate the consensus, and decide whether to accept, reject, or postpone the RFC.

5. Implementation: If an RFC is accepted, it is assigned to a team or an individual to implement it. The implementation is done on a separate branch or fork of the Rust repository, and it is subject to code review, testing, and community feedback.

6. Merge: Once the implementation is deemed stable, it is merged into the Rust main branch, and becomes part of the next Rust release.
