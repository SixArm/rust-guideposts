# catch_unwind! macro to handle panic

The Rust `panic` `catch_unwind!` macro is a way to catch unwinding panics that can occur when a piece of code fails at runtime. When an unwinding panic happens, Rust unwinds the stack and calls the panic handler, which can be customized to do any number of things, such as print an error message or roll back a transaction.

The `catch_unwind!` macro allows you to catch these unwinding panics and handle them in a more controlled way. It returns a Result value that lets you know if the code in the block panicked or not. If it did panic, you can then handle the error in any way you see fit, such as printing an error message or returning an alternate value.

Here's an example of how to use the `catch_unwind!` macro:

```rust
use std::panic;

let result = panic::catch_unwind(|| {
    // Code that might panic goes here
});

match result {
    Ok(_) => println!("Code did not panic"),
    Err(_) => println!("Code panicked!"),
}
```

In this example, we define a closure that contains the code we want to run. We then pass that closure to the `catch_unwind!` macro. If the code within the closure panics, the result value will be an `Err` value. If it doesn't panic, the result value will be an `Ok` value.

The `catch_unwind!` macro is not guaranteed to succeed, for example when using custom panics or aborting panics. Additionally, the `catch_unwind!` macro is not generally recommended outside of FFI purposes. To help prevent panics, Rust provides many non-panic functions, such as Vec `get` instead of slice, and `checked_add` instead of operator addition. To help documentation show panics, Rust Clippy provides the lint `missing_panics_doc`.
