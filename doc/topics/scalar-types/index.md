# Scalar types

Rust has several scalar types that represent basic values and data structures. These types are built into the language and do not require any additional dependencies or libraries to use.

Boolean (bool): Represents a logical value, either true or false.

```rust
let a: bool = true;
```

Signed integers (i8, i16, i32, i64, i128): Represent whole numbers that can be positive or negative. The number after the 'i' represents the number of bits the integer type uses.

```rust
let a: i8 = 1;
let b: i16 = 1;
let c: i32 = 1;
let d: i64 = 1;
let e: i128 = 1;
```

Unsigned integers (u8, u16, u32, u64, u128): Represent whole numbers that can only be positive. The number after the 'u' represents the number of bits the integer type uses.

```rust
let a: u8 = 1;
let b: u16 = 1;
let c: u32 = 1;
let d: u64 = 1;
let e: u128 = 1;
```

Floating-point numbers (f32, f64): Represent decimal numbers with single or double precision.

```rust
let a: f32 = 1.0;
let b: f64 = 1.0;
```

Character (char): Represents a single Unicode character.

```rust
let a: char = 'a';
```
