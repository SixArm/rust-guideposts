# Integration testing

Integration testing is a software testing technique where individual software modules are tested as a group to validate their combined functionality. In Rust, integration testing involves testing the interactions between different modules or components of the software.

Rust provides a built-in testing framework for integration testing called `cargo test`. Here are the steps involved in Rust integration testing:

* Create a separate directory for integration tests: Integration tests in Rust are typically placed in a separate directory called `tests` at the top level of the project. This directory contains Rust files that end with `_test.rs`.

* Write the integration tests: Integration tests in Rust are similar to unit tests but test the interaction between different modules or components. These tests should be written to validate the expected behavior of the system as a whole.

* Use Rust's testing framework: Rust's testing framework provides a set of macros and functions for writing and running tests. The `#[cfg(test)]` attribute indicates that a Rust module contains tests.

* Run the tests: Integration tests in Rust can be run using the `cargo test` command. This command compiles and runs all the tests in the project, including the integration tests.

* Analyze the test results: After the tests have run, the output of the tests can be analyzed to determine whether the integration tests have passed or failed. Rust's testing framework provides detailed information about the tests that have been run, including the number of tests that have passed or failed and the reason for the failures.

By following these steps, developers can use Rust's integration testing framework to validate the interactions between different modules or components of the software, ensuring that the software functions correctly as a whole.
