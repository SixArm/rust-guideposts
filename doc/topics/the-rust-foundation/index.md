# The Rust Foundation

The Rust Foundation is a nonprofit organization that was formed in 2020 to manage the development and direction of the Rust programming language.

The Rust Foundation aims to provide an official structure for the Rust community, protect the intellectual property of the language, and oversee the development of Rust. The foundation will allow Rust to be more widely adopted in industry settings, and provide financial support for key initiatives and infrastructure projects.

The Rust Foundation is governed by a board of directors, made up of individuals and organizations that have an interest in the success of Rust. These directors are responsible for setting the direction of the foundation, managing financial resources, and ensuring the continued success of the Rust programming language.

## Community Grants Program

The Rust Foundation runs a grants program for the Rust community. These grants are complementing the existing ecosystem of funding for the Rust community, not replacing it. The objectives are to support the maintainers of Rust, and to support and grow the community of Rust users.

Grants include event support grants, Rust Foundation Fellowships, project grants for discrete pieces of work, and more.
