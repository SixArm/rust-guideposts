# Model-view-controller (MVC)

Model-View-Controller (MVC) is a design pattern commonly used in software engineering for developing user interfaces. It provides a way to separate an application's data (the Model), user interface (the View), and control logic (the Controller) into separate components, which helps in making the code more modular, easier to understand, and maintain.

In the context of Rust, the Model-View-Controller pattern is often used in web application development:

* Model: The Model represents the business logic. It defines the structures and operations for working with the business data, business rules, business reports, and so forth. In a web application, a typical Model may also be responsible for loading and saving data, by connecting to a database.

* View: The View is responsible for presenting the data to the user. It defines the user interface elements, such as HTML templates, CSS styles, and JavaScript front-end code, that the user sees in their browser. In a web application, a typical View renders the data provided by the Controller.

* Controller: The Controller is the intermediary between the Model and View. It receives input from the user, processes it, and updates the Model as necessary. It also retrieves data from the Model and passes it to the View for rendering. In a web application, a typical Controller handles HTTP requests and responses.

By separating the application's data, user interface, and control logic into separate components, the MVC pattern makes it easier to maintain and modify the application. For example, if you want to change the user interface, you modify the View without affecting the underlying data or business logic. Or if you want to change the way data is stored or manipulated, you modify the Model without affecting the user interface.
