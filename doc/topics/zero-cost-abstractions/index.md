# Zero-cost abstractions

In Rust, zero-cost abstractions are a design principle that refers to the idea that abstractions, such as functions and data structures, should not impose any runtime overhead compared to the equivalent low-level, manual code that they replace.

This means that, while Rust's standard library provides a high-level API with powerful abstractions, the generated code should be just as fast and efficient as if the code were manually written with lower-level constructs.

To achieve this, Rust uses a combination of static analysis and code generation techniques, such as inlining, loop unrolling, and code specialization. For example, the Rust compiler may choose to inline a function call instead of generating code to jump to the function at runtime, thereby avoiding the overhead of a function call.

Furthermore, Rust's ownership and borrowing system allows the compiler to optimize the generated code by eliminating unnecessary memory allocations and deallocations, reducing runtime overhead and improving performance.

This approach allows Rust developers to write high-level code that is easy to read and maintain, while still achieving the performance and efficiency of low-level code. This makes Rust a popular choice for performance-critical applications, such as game engines, web browsers, and operating systems.

Overall, zero-cost abstractions are an important aspect of Rust's design, and they enable Rust to combine high-level abstractions with low-level performance, making it a powerful and efficient language for building complex and performance-critical systems.
