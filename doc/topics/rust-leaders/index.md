# Rust leaders

Rust is a community-driven, so it does not have any official leaders in the traditional sense. However, there are  individuals and organizations that have contributed significantly to the language and its ecosystem.

* Mozilla was the primary sponsor of Rust's development from its inception until 2021. Mozilla employed some of the core developers of the language, and provided significant financial and technical resources.

* The Rust Core Team is a group of volunteer developers who are responsible for maintaining the Rust language specification, overseeing the language development, and guiding the community.

* Steve Klabnik is a software developer known for his contributions to the Rust programming language and community. He is the author of "The Rust Programming Language" book, a co-author of "Rust for Rubyists," and has been actively involved in the development and promotion of Rust since its early days.

* Andrew Gallant a.k.a. BurntSushi is a programmer known for his popular software libraries, including the regex and glob crates, and the ripgrep utility, a fast and powerful file search tool.

* Carol Nichols is a Rust developer and community leader who has played a significant role in promoting Rust's adoption and educating developers about the language. She is the co-author of the book "The Rust Programming Language".

* Ashley Williams is a Rust developer and community leader who has been involved in Rust since its early days. She is the co-founder of the Rust Bridge initiative, which provides workshops and resources to help underrepresented groups learn Rust.

These are just a few highlights. Rust's community is open and collaborative, and anyone can contribute.
