<https://www.rust-lang.org/governance>

Rust governance refers to the system in place for managing and directing the development and maintenance of the Rust programming language. Rust governance is characterized by the following key components:

* RFC process: The Rust RFC (Request for Comments) process is how changes are proposed and accepted into Rust. An RFC is a document proposing a significant change or new feature to Rust, which is rigorously reviewed and discussed by the community before it is accepted or rejected.

* Core team: The Rust core team is responsible for the overall strategy and direction of Rust development, managing the Rust project's infrastructure, and overseeing various Rust teams.

* Teams: There are many different teams within the Rust community that work on specific areas of Rust development, such as the compiler, Cargo (the Rust package manager), documentation, and community outreach. Each team has a leadership structure and is responsible for driving the development of their respective area.

* Working groups: There are a working groups of contributors focused on specific aspects of Rust development, such as asynchronoous programming, command-line interfaces, embedded devices, security responses, and WebAssembly.

* Stewardship: The Rust community has a concept of "stewardship," in which individuals or groups take responsibility for specific areas of Rust development. Stewards are responsible for ensuring that their area of Rust is maintained and developed in a way that aligns with the overall goals and values of Rust.
