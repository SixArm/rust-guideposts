# Static analysis for error detection

Static analysis is the process of analyzing code without executing it, to detect potential errors or issues before the code is actually run. Rust has a strong focus on static analysis, with the goal of catching as many errors as possible at compile time, before the code is even executed.

Rust's static analysis features include:

* Static typing: Rust is a statically typed language, meaning that the type of a variable is known at compile time. This helps catch many common errors, such as trying to add a string and a number, before the code is even run.

* Ownership and borrowing: Rust's ownership and borrowing system helps prevent memory errors such as null pointer dereferences or use-after-free bugs. The compiler enforces rules around how references to data are created, modified, and used, to ensure that they are safe and sound.

* Lifetimes: Rust's lifetime system helps ensure that references to data are valid for as long as they are needed. This prevents common errors such as dangling pointers or double frees.

* Macros: Rust's macro system allows developers to write code that generates other code at compile time. This can be used to perform custom static analysis or generate repetitive code automatically.

* Clippy: Clippy is a community-maintained linter for Rust that provides additional static analysis checks beyond what the compiler itself does. Clippy checks for common coding mistakes, such as unused variables, and provides suggestions for how to fix them.

Overall, Rust's strong focus on static analysis helps catch many errors before they occur, reducing the likelihood of bugs and making it easier to write safe and reliable code.
