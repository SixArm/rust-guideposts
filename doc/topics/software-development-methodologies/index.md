# Software development methodologies

Software development methodologies are a set of practices and techniques that are followed by software development teams to manage the software development life cycle (SDLC). These methodologies provide a framework for organizing and managing the various stages of software development, including planning, analysis, design, coding, testing, and maintenance.

There are many different software development methodologies, each with its unique approach and focus. Here are some of the most common software development methodologies:

* Waterfall Methodology: Waterfall is a linear, sequential approach to software development where each stage must be completed before the next one can begin.

* Agile Methodology: Agile is an iterative approach to software development that focuses on delivering working software in short sprints.

* Kanban Methodology: Kanban is a visual approach to software development that focuses on managing workflow and minimizing waste.

* Lean Methodology: Lean is a methodology that focuses on eliminating waste and optimizing processes.

Each software development methodology has its strengths and weaknesses, and the choice of methodology depends on the nature of the project, team structure, and other factors.
