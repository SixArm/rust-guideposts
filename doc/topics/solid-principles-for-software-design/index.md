# SOLID principles for software design

The SOLID principles are a set of five design principles in object-oriented programming that aim to make software designs more flexible, maintainable, and easy to understand.

* Single Responsibility Principle (SRP): This states that a module or class should have only one reason to change. In other words, a module should have only one responsibility or job, and it should not be responsible for doing more than that. This helps to keep code organized, understandable, and maintainable.

* Open/Closed Principle (OCP): This states that a module or class should be open for extension but closed for modification. This means that you should be able to extend the functionality of a module or class without having to modify its existing code. This makes the code more flexible and easier to maintain over time.

* Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP): This states that a subclass should be able to replace its parent class without affecting the correctness of the program. This means that a subclass should be able to behave as expected by the client code, without requiring any modifications to the client code. This helps to ensure that code is more modular and easier to maintain.

* Interface Segregation Principle (ISP): This states that a module or class should only expose the methods and properties that are necessary for its clients. Meaning, a module or class should not force its clients to depend on methods or properties that they do not need. This reduce dependencies and make code maintainable.

* Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP): This states that high-level modules or classes should not depend on low-level modules or classes, but on abstractions. You should define interfaces and abstractions to represent the dependencies in your code, rather than depending directly on concrete implementations. This helps make code flexible, testable, and maintainable.
