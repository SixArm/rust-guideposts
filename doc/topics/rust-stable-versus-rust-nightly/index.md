# Rust stable versus Rust nightly

In Rust, there are two main channels of development for the compiler and language: the Rust stable channel and the Rust nightly channel.

The Rust stable channel is the main release channel for Rust, where only stable and well-tested features are included. The goal of this channel is to provide a stable and reliable Rust experience for most users. The stable channel has a predictable release schedule and is recommended for most users.

The Rust nightly channel is a more experimental channel that contains bleeding-edge features that are still under development. The nightly channel is updated more frequently than the stable channel, and it may contain features that are not yet stable or well-tested. The nightly channel is intended for developers who want to experiment with new features, contribute to the Rust project, or provide early feedback on new features.

Some features are only available on the nightly channel, while others are only available on the stable channel. In general, the Rust team works to stabilize features as quickly as possible and move them to the stable channel.

To switch between the stable and nightly channels, you can use the rustup tool.

To switch to the latest stable version of Rust, you can run:

```
rustup default stable
```

To switch to the latest nightly version of Rust, you can run:

```
rustup default nightly
```

Overall, the choice between the stable and nightly channels depends on your needs. If you want a stable and reliable Rust experience, you should use the stable channel. If you want to experiment with new features or contribute to the Rust project, you may want to use the nightly channel.
