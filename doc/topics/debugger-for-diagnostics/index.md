# Debugger for diagnostics

A debugger is a software tool that allows developers to pause a program's execution at specific points in its code to examine its internal state and debug any issues.

Debuggers can be run either from the command line or through an integrated development environment (IDE).

Debuggers allow developers to step through code line by line, set breakpoints, and inspect variables and memory at runtime.

Rust's built-in debugger is called GDB (GNU Debugger), and it's available on most platforms.

Additionally, there are also third-party Rust debugging tools like Rust-GDB and Rust-LLLD, which offer specialized features like improved integration with Rust development environments, better support for multi-threaded applications, and more:

* Rust-GDB: an implementation of GNU Debugger (GDB) that is customized specifically for debugging Rust programs.

* Rust-LLDB: a debugger that allows developers to analyze and debug Rust programs using the LLVM debugger (LLDB) tool.
