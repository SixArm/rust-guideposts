# Rust for graphical user interfaces (GUIs)

Rust has a few options for developers to choose from, when it comes to developing GUI graphical user interfaces,

One popular option is the Rust bindings for the GTK+ toolkit. GTK+ is a widely-used toolkit for creating graphical user interfaces on Linux and other platforms. The Rust bindings for GTK+ provide a Rust API for creating GTK+ applications, which can be used to create rich and responsive graphical user interfaces.

Another option is the Rust bindings for the Qt toolkit. Qt is a cross-platform toolkit for creating graphical user interfaces, and the Rust bindings provide a Rust API for using Qt to create applications.

In addition to these options, there are also several Rust crates (Rust's term for libraries) that are specifically designed for creating graphical user interfaces, such as Iced, Druid, and OrbTk. These crates provide Rust developers with a range of options for creating beautiful and responsive GUI applications.

Some of the crates for GUIs are the druid crate (inspired by React), the iced crate (inspired by Elm), the egui crate (build on top of wgpu), and the native-windows-gui crate (for Microsoft Windows APIs):.
