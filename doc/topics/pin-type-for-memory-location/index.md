# Pin type for memory location

<https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/pin/>

Rust `Pin` type is a type that is used to express that a value should not be moved in memory. When an object is pinned, it means that its memory location cannot change, even if other parts of the program try to move it.

The `Pin` type is commonly used in Rust when dealing with data structures that hold references to other objects. In such cases, moving the data structure could invalidate the references, leading to undefined behavior.

To create a pinned object, you can use the `Pin::new` function, which takes a reference to the object and returns a `Pin` wrapper around it. This Pin wrapper can then be used to access the object, but it cannot be moved or dropped without first calling the unpin method on it.

Additionally, Rust provides a `Pin<&mut T>` type, which can be used to create a pinned reference to a mutable object. This allows you to modify the object through the reference while still ensuring that its memory location does not change.

Overall, Rust Pin `type` is an important tool for ensuring memory safety when dealing with complex data structures and references. It allows you to express the requirement that certain objects should not be moved in memory, which can help prevent bugs and ensure the correctness of your program.
