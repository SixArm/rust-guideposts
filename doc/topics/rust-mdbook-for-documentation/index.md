# Rust mdBook for documentation

Rust mdBook is a tool for creating and publishing documentation in the form of books or websites. Rust mdBook is designed for documenting Rust projects, but it can be used for any kind of documentation. Rust mdBook supports various Markdown features and more, including syntax highlighting for code blocks, table of contents generation, cross-referencing between pages, customizable themes, and documentation by using Rustdoc comments.

To install the `mdbook` tool and the `mdbook-pdf` tool:

```sh
cargo install mdbook
cargo install mdbook-pdf
cargo install mdbook-toc
```

To use Rust mdBook, you create a book directory that contains the Markdown files and any associated assets, such as images or code samples. You can then use the mdBook command-line tool to compile the book into the desired format. The resulting output can be published as a website or distributed as an eBook or PDF.

To use Rust mdBook PDF, you may need to install additional software, such as a web browser that can render PDF. Rust mdBook PDF has installation options to automatically download and install the Chromium web browser, which can render PDF. See the Rust mdBook PDF documentation for more information.

To use Rust mdBook TOC (table of contents), you can use the default markup `<!-- tod -->`, then the build will automatically generate a table of contents. See the rust mdBook TOC documentation for more information.

Overall, Rust mdBook makes it easy to create high-quality documentation that is easy to read and understand.
