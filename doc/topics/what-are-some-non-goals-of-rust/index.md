# What are some non-goals of Rust?

These non-goals are listed in a previous official Rust FAQ.

1. We do not employ any particularly cutting-edge technologies. Old, established techniques are better.

2. We do not prize expressiveness, minimalism or elegance above other goals. These are desirable but subordinate goals.

3. We do not intend to cover the complete feature-set of C++, or any other language. Rust should provide majority-case features.

4. We do not intend to be 100% static, 100% safe, 100% reflective, or too dogmatic in any other sense. Trade-offs exist.

5. We do not demand that Rust run on “every possible platform”. It must eventually work without unnecessary compromises on widely-used hardware and software platforms.
