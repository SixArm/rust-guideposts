# Unit testing

Unit testing is a software testing technique where individual software components or units are tested in isolation to ensure that they behave as expected. In Rust, unit testing involves writing tests that validate the expected behavior of functions, methods, and other individual units of code.

Rust provides a built-in testing framework for unit testing called `cargo test`.

* Unit tests are typically placed in the same file as the code they are testing. These tests should be written to validate the expected behavior of each function and method.

* Use the `#[cfg(test)]` attribute indicates that a Rust module contains tests.

* Use assertions, such as the Rust standard library `assert_eq!` assertion, or Assertables crate `assert_starts_with!` assertion.

* Unit tests in Rust can be run using the `cargo test` command. This command compiles and runs all the tests in the project, including the unit tests.

* After the tests have run, the output of the tests can be analyzed to determine whether the unit tests have passed or failed. Rust's testing framework provides detailed information about the tests that have been run, including the number of tests that have passed or failed and the reason for the failures.

By following these steps, developers can use Rust's unit testing framework to validate the behavior of individual components of the software, ensuring that each unit behaves as expected and functions correctly as part of the larger system.
