# Domain-driven design (DDD)

Domain-driven design (DDD) is a software development approach that emphasizes building software that reflects the business domain it is intended to serve. In Rust, DDD involves structuring the codebase around the domain model, ensuring that the code is easy to understand, and that changes to the domain can be made without causing issues elsewhere in the system.

Here are some key principles of Rust DDD:

* Separation of concerns: DDD encourages separating the domain model from other parts of the system. In Rust, this means creating separate modules for each component of the domain model and using Rust's module system to control access to these modules.

* Ubiquitous language: DDD emphasizes using a common language between developers and domain experts. In Rust, this means creating types and structs that map directly to domain concepts, and using descriptive names for variables and functions.

* Entities and value objects: In DDD, entities are objects that have a unique identity, and value objects are objects that are identified by their attributes. In Rust, entities and value objects can be implemented as Rust structs with associated methods.

* Aggregates: Aggregates are clusters of related entities and value objects that should be treated as a single unit of consistency. In Rust, aggregates can be implemented as Rust structs with associated methods that enforce consistency constraints.

* Repositories: Repositories provide a way to retrieve and store aggregates. In Rust, repositories can be implemented as Rust traits with associated methods for retrieving and storing aggregates.

Rust domain-driven design can help developers create software that is easy to understand, maintain, and extend, while also ensuring that the software aligns with the business domain.
