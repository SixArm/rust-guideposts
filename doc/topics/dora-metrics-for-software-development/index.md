# DORA metrics for software development

DevOps Research and Assessment (DORA) metrics are a set of key performance indicators that are used to measure the software development process in terms of its speed, quality, and reliability.

The four key metrics:

* Deployment Frequency: This metric measures how frequently the code changes are deployed to production. A high deployment frequency means that the development team is able to release changes quickly, which is a key factor for successful DevOps. It also indicates that the team is able to rapidly innovate and respond to customer needs.

* Lead Time for Changes: This metric quantifies the time from when code is committed to when it is deployed to production. A lower lead time indicates a more efficient software development process.

* Change Failure Rate: This metric measures the percentage of deployments that result in a failure or require a rollback. A high change failure rate indicates a lack of quality control in the development process, which can lead to customer dissatisfaction and lost revenue.

* Time to Restore Service: This metric measures the time it takes to restore a service after a failure or outage. A shorter time to restore service indicates that the development team is able to quickly identify and resolve issues, which helps minimize disruptions to the end-users.
